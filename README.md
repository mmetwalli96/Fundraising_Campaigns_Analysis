### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The lunch date was converted from unix timestamp to a readable format, using the following formula =(((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1), where J is the column in which the unix timestamp values exist and 2 is the number of the row. After doing that, it possible to know the year of each event. The function __year__ was utilized to creat a column containing the year, to allow for filtration based on the year. Hence, the pivot table was created ant its fields were apointed as illustrated in figure 1. ![Capture 85](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59425631/123569538-7bf94f00-d794-11eb-9f0f-599619342ce3.PNG)
